Feature: As a Supporter Services User I need to initiate the refund approval for a supporter
  So that the appropriate donation/gifts are refunded or sent for further approval


  Scenario Outline: The user should be able to save the record successfully with incomplete fields
    Given I login to Salesforce URL
    When I click on Contacts tag
    And I click on Recently Viewed dropdown Select List View
    And I select "All Contacts" from the list view
    And I type the contact "Samaira" in the Search box and press Enter to view the particular contact detail
    And I click on the searched contact name
    And I click the Opportunities button
    And I click on Opportunities name Samaira Malhotra FR00009 Donation link
    And I click on "Related" Tab
    And I click on Payment
    And I click "Refund" radio button


    And I select on Refund's "Save" button
