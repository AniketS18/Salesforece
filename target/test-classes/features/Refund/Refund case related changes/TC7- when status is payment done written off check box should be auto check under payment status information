Feature: As a Supporter Services User I need to initiate the refund approval for a supporter
  So that the appropriate donation/gifts are refunded or sent for further approval


  Scenario Outline: The user should be able to save the record successfully with incomplete fields
    Given I login to Salesforce URL
    When I click on Cases tag
    And I provide case number 00001372 to the search box
    And I click on the searched case number
    And I scroll down to page
    And I clicked on Refund Payment number
    And I scroll down to page
    And I scroll down to page
    Then I verify Written Off in Payment Status is checked

    Examples:
      | Case Origin | Refund Type | Subject | Status | Refund Amount | Refund Instrument | Bank Account No | Bank BSB |
      | Email | Partial | Refund For sally den PMT-01963 | Open | 10  | Bank Deposit | 2901928653 | 203946 |
